VTS allows to covert external hierarchical mesh formats into VTS tilesets. These include so far ESRI SLPK (.spk) format, Bentley Context capture LODTree and Leica Citymapper DAE export (accepted by ``lodtree2vts``) and `VEF <https://github.com/melowntech/true3d-format-spec>`__ open transport format proposed by Melown.

There are also two special encoders to concert from VTS tilesets and VEF.

The most important options are common to all convertors to VTS.

``input``
    Path to input file/directory. All convertors can input as directory, zip archive or plain tar archive.
``output``
    Path to output VTS tileset.
``tilesetId``
    Output tilesetId.
``referenceFrame``
    Output tileset's :ref:`reference frame <reference-frame>`.
``zShift``
    Manual heigh adjustment of the output. Usefull for minor fixes of georeferencing.
``overwrite``
    Overwrites output tileset if present.

Converts VTS tilesets between reference frames. If original data are available in some non-VTS format, it is always better to create tileset in desired reference frame by encoding it directly from the original data. The use of ``vts2vts`` is advisible only if the original data is not available.

``input``
    Path to input file/directory. All convertors can input as directory, zip archive or plain tar archive.
``output``
    Path to output VTS tileset.
``referenceFrame``
    Output tileset's :ref:`reference frame <reference-frame>`.
``overwrite``
    Overwrites output tileset if present.
