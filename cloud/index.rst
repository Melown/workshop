Cloud REST API
==============

Beside HTML user interface, there is `Cloud REST API
<https://github.com/melowntech/mario-cloud-api>`_ being developed, so that advanced
users (programmers), can integrate the service in their applications.

The `API is documented using Swagger <http://editor.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMelown%2Fmario-cloud-api%2Fmaster%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2Findex.yaml#>`_. 

There are also code samples, using Python, in `the tests directory
<https://github.com/melowntech/mario-cloud-api/blob/master/tests/test_mario.py>`_.

Please, `refer to the documentation
<https://github.com/melowntech/mario-cloud-api/tree/master/docs>`_ for more
informations.
