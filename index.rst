Welcome to Melown 3D Stack - Workshop
=====================================


The Melown (http://melown.com) API and open source library provides a technology
for interactive rendering of 3D maps across platofrms and form factors. It is
client-server architecture with back-end component (VTS) and JavaScript
front-end library.

The workshop’s topic is complete Melown’s 3D open source stack
(https://github.com/melown/). The workshop consists of three parts: In the first
part, we are are going to give the introduction to the concepts and 3D
visualisation principles and naming convention used in Melown. In the second
part, Melown server (back-end) is introduced. We are going to setup and
configure Melown server (mapping proxy) and configure data sources from public
services. We also will add custom vector data and visualise them on top of
digital elevation model. In the last part, we are going to create web
application consuming data from configured server and visualising them in the
web browser. We will demonstrate capabilities of the JavaScript library and show
the ways the map can be embed to existing web page. In the closing part, Melown
web administration console (https://www.melown.com/console) will be presented,
where all the parts are ready-to-use in our cloud platform for less technical
skilled users.
