The Peaks and Valleys of Mars
-----------------------------

If you have encountered 3D interactive Mars websites such as `Mars in Google Earth <https://www.google.com/maps/space/mars>`_ or `NASA's Mars Trek <https://marstrek.jpl.nasa.gov/index.html>`_ you probably stood in awe at how much work went into them. 

Yet with help of Melown Tech's VTS 3D mapping stack and publicly available data sources, you can roll a similar website in a couple of hours. Actually, with little extra thought and work and in some respects, your site might be even superior to its aforementioned respectable counterparts! This tutorial will walk you through the process.

Prerequisites
"""""""""""""

As a prerequisite to this tutorial, you need to have your VTS backend environment set up. You can :doc:`follow our earlier tutorial <vtsbackend>` to do so.

The Terrain

The Global Mosaic
"""""""""""""""""

The Nomenclature
""""""""""""""""

That's it! Now we have a browseable, interactive 3D map of Mars, complete with labels. In some of our next tutorials, we're going to take a look at how to complement this map with even more visual detail and compelling features.
