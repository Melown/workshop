GeoJSON: Import and Styling with VTS-Browser-JS
-----------------------------------------------

This tutorial provides a step by step guide how to import and visualize
sample GeoJSON data with `VTS-Browser-JS <https://github.com/melowntech/vts-browser-js>`_.

In detail we'll take a look how to display the VTS browser on a webpage. Next
we'll load some GeoJSON data and display them. And finally we'll take a
sneak peek into the possibilities of visual style customization.

You can find the code and a `live demo <https://jsfiddle.net/1xf3bxz9/>`__ of
this tutorial on JSFiddle.

GeoJSON
^^^^^^^

GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple
geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes, based on
JavaScript Object Notation. You can view the specs 
`here <http://geojson.org/>`_.

.. 
    VTS Browser JS
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The VTS Browser JS is a JavaScript WebGL rendering engine used and
    developed by `Melown Technologies SE <http://melown.com>`__ as part of
    the VTS 3D Geospatial Software Stack.

Displaying the browser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To display the VTS Browser, add the necessary CSS and
JavaScript resources and create a ``div`` with an id like ``map-div``.

.. code-block:: html

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.melown.com/libs/vtsjs/browser/v2/vts-browser.min.css"/>
          <script src="https://cdn.melown.com/libs/vtsjs/browser/v2/vts-browser.min.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
         <div id="map-div" style="width:100%; height:100%;"></div>
         <script>
             <!-- add your js code here -->
         </script>
      </body>
    </html>

Now that we've prepared our HTML structure we can add some JavaScript
code to make the browser run.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var browser = null;
    var renderer = null;
    var map = null;
    var geodata = null;

    function startDemo() {
        browser = vts.browser('map-div', {
            map: 'https://cdn.melown.com/mario/store/melown2015/map-config/melown/VTS-Tutorial-map/mapConfig.json',
            position : [ 'obj', -122.48443455025, 37.83071587047, 'float', 0.00, 19.04, -49.56, 0.00, 1946.45, 55.00 ]
        });

        //check whether browser is supported
        if (!browser) {
            console.log('Your web browser does not support WebGL');
            return;
        }

        //callback once is map config loaded
        browser.on('map-loaded', onMapLoaded);
    }

    function onMapLoaded() {
      // geojson loading here
    }

    startDemo();

We created a map in place of the ``map-div`` and set the ``map`` parameter
to point to a map configuration we prepared in Melown Cloud for this purpose. 
You can create your own map in `Melown Cloud <https://www.melown.com/cloud>`_. We set the
`position <https://github.com/melowntech/vts-browser-js/wiki/VTS-Browser-Map-API#position>`_
to San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge. You can discover more about
browser configuration parameters in
`documentation <https://github.com/melowntech/vts-browser-js/wiki/VTS-Browser-API#options>`_.

Once the map loads we can start with
importing a GeoJSON. We achieve this by using the callback function
``onMapLoaded`` and registering it to listen for the ``map-loaded`` event.
You should now see the following:

Adding GeoJSON data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's assume we have the following GeoJSON data containing a sample trek
trough Golden Gate Bridge Vista Point.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var json = {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": [
            {
                "type": "Feature",
                "geometry": {
                    "type": "Point",
                    "coordinates": [-122.48347, 37.82955],
                },
                "properties": {
                    "title": "Golden Gate Bridge Vista Point",
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Feature",
                "properties": {},
                "geometry": {
                    "type": "LineString",
                    "coordinates": [
                        [-122.48369693756, 37.83381888486],
                        [-122.48344236083, 37.83317489144],
                        [-122.48335253015, 37.83270036637],
                        [-122.48361819152, 37.83205636317],
                        [-122.48404026031, 37.83114119107],
                        [-122.48404026031, 37.83049717427],
                        [-122.48348236083, 37.82992094395],
                        [-122.48356819152, 37.82954808664],
                        [-122.48507022857, 37.82944639795],
                        [-122.48610019683, 37.82880236636],
                        [-122.48695850372, 37.82931081282],
                        [-122.48700141906, 37.83080223556],
                        [-122.48751640319, 37.83168351665],
                        [-122.48803138732, 37.83215804826],
                        [-122.48888969421, 37.83297152392],
                        [-122.48987674713, 37.83263257682],
                        [-122.49043464660, 37.83293762928],
                        [-122.49125003814, 37.83242920781],
                        [-122.49163627624, 37.83256478721],
                        [-122.49223709106, 37.83337825839],
                        [-122.49378204345, 37.83368330777]
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }

The data contains two features. One point and one line represented by a list
of coordinates. In addition to geometry data every feature can
have custom properties such as a title, as in the current example. We'll
take advantage of this later in the tutorial.

To load the data into the browser we need to implement the ``onMapLoaded()``
function mentioned earlier:

.. code-block:: javascript

    function onMapLoaded() {
        map = browser.map;
        
        // create geodata object
        geodata = map.createGeodata();

        // import GeoJSON data
        geodata.importGeoJson(json);

        geodata.processHeights('node-by-precision', 62, onHeightsProcessed);
    }

We create a ``geodata`` object with ``map.createGeodata()`` that we can 
use to import a GeoJSON with ``geodata.importGeoJson(json, <mode = float>)``. During the
import, the height of features is interpreted either as above the terrain
(``float`` mode, default) or above ellipsoid (``fix`` mode). 
If heights are missing, 0 is assumed and therefore ``float`` should be used.
``geodata.processHeights(...)`` must be called for every ``float`` data to 
display them correctly.

At the moment VTS Browser does not support importing polygons
as a feature type.

.. code-block:: javascript

    function onHeightsProcessed() {

        var style = {
            // add your style here
        };

        // make free layer
        var freeLayer = geodata.makeFreeLayer(style);

        // add free layer to the map
        map.addFreeLayer('geodatatest', freeLayer);

        // add free layer to the list of free layers
        // which will be rendered on the map
        let view = map.getView();
        view.freeLayers.geodatatest = {};
        map.setView(view);
    }

The function ``onHeightsProcessed()`` creates a free layer out of the GeoJSON
data and adds our custom style to it. Now you have all the data rendered,
but it's still invisible because we need to first add some styles to
the newly created layers.

Basic styling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's start with a really basic one. We'll omit point data for now
and just display a magenta line. To do so, let's change the style object to the following:

::

    var style = {
        layers: {
            "track-line" : {
                "filter" : ["==", "#type", "line"],
                "line": true,
                "line-width" : 4,
                "line-color": [255,0,255,255]
            }
        }
    };

.. figure:: ./images/geojson-basic.jpg
   :alt: Basic styling

   Basic styling

``style`` now contains the property ``layers`` which works as a container
component for all style layers we want to use. Direct children of
``layers`` can have arbitrary names. In the example above we've added
one style layer and named it ``track-line``. A style layer can have
multiple properties that you can find
`here <https://github.com/melowntech/vts-browser-js/wiki/VTS-Geodata-Format#layers-structure>`__.
The most important one is ``filter``.

Filter is used to select features from the GeoJSON to which we want to apply
a set of display rules described in the current style layer. In our example we
are applying display rules to all lines. This filter selects everything
from features where ``type`` equals ``line``. The ``"line":true`` means
we want to display the current feature as a line. ``line-width`` specifies
line width. And finally we set line color to magenta with ``line-color``,
which accepts RGBA values as an array.

You can find a comprehensive documentation for styles
`here <https://github.com/melowntech/vts-browser-js/wiki/VTS-Geodata-Format#geo-layer-styles-structure>`__.

Advanced styling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may have noticed that the line dives under the surface. This happens due
to interpolation of line height between points. We can fix this by adding
``zbuffer-offset`` to the ``track-line`` layer. Try to add
``"zbuffer-offset": [-0.5, 0, 0]`` and see the difference.

.. figure:: ./images/geojson-zbuffer.jpg
   :alt: Displayed track with ``zbuffer-offset``

   Displayed track with ``zbuffer-offset``

Now we'll add a shadow to the line's visual style.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var style = {
        layers: {
            "track-line" : {
                "filter" : ["==", "#type", "line"],
                "line": true,
                "line-width" : 4,
                "line-color": [255,0,255,255],
                "zbuffer-offset" : [-0.5,0,0],
                "z-index" : -1
            },
            "track-shadow" : {
                "filter" : ["==", "#type", "line"],
                "line": true,
                "line-width" : 20,
                "line-color": [0,0,0,120],
                "zbuffer-offset" : [-0.5,0,0],
            }
        }
    };

   :alt: Added track shadow

Okay, so far we have managed to visualize a line feature. But if we
go back to our sample GeoJSON data we notice that it contains a feature
of type point as well. We'll focus on visualizing that one now.

We'll make the point appear as a green circle with it's title displayed
above it.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var style = {
        "constants": {
            "@icon-marker": ['icons', 6, 8, 18, 18]
        },
        "bitmaps": {
            "icons": 'http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/kml/shapes/placemark_circle.png'
        },
        "layers": {
             "track-line" : {
                "filter" : ["==", "#type", "line"],
                "line": true,
                "line-width" : 4,
                "line-color": [255,0,255,255],
                "zbuffer-offset" : [-0.5,0,0],
                "z-index" : -1
            },
            "track-shadow" : {
                "filter" : ["==", "#type", "line"],
                "line": true,
                "line-width" : 20,
                "line-color": [0,0,0,120],
                "zbuffer-offset" : [-0.5,0,0],
            },
         
            // added new style for point
            "place" : {
                    "filter":["==", "#type", "point"],
                    
                    "icon": true,
                    "icon-source": '@icon-marker',
                    "icon-color": [0,255,0,255],
                    "icon-scale": 2,
                    "icon-origin": 'center-center',
                    
                    "label": true,
                    "label-size": 19,
                    "label-source": "$title",
                    "label-offset": [0,-20],
                    "zbuffer-offset" : [-1,0,0]
            }
        }
    }; 

We've added two new properties to ``style``. The ``bitmap.icons`` defines
a URL with overlay icon resource. In ``constants`` we define
variables that can be reused troughout the style object. Here we define
the constant ``@icon-marker`` and select a rectangle out of ``icons`` PNG.
The first two numbers in the array define the top left corner and the last two numbers
the bottom right corner in image coordinates.

We've also added a new layer group ``place`` to ``layers``. Notice that
now we have used a different ``filter`` to select all points instead. For
``icon-source`` we have used the defined constant. Notice that for
``label-source`` we used ``$title``. This means that the contents of the point's
``title`` property should be used as a label. The rest of the style
properties are self-explanatory.

That's it for now, you've made it to the end :)

In the `next
tutorial <http://vtsdocs.melown.com/en/latest/tutorials/geojson-part2.html>`__
we'll take a look at loading extra data from the URL and extending the track.
