The Peaks and Valleys of Mars
-----------------------------

If you have encountered 3D interactive Mars websites such as `Mars in Google Earth <https://www.google.com/maps/space/mars>`_ or `NASA Mars Trek <https://marstrek.jpl.nasa.gov/index.html>`_ you probably stood in awe at how much work went into them. 

Yet with the help Melown Tech's VTS 3D map streaming and rendering stack and using only publicly available data sources, you can run a similar website in a couple of hours. And if you put some extra thought and work into it, your site might even be superior to its aforementioned respectable counterparts in some respects! This tutorial will walk you through the process.

Preparation
"""""""""""

As a prerequisite, you need to have your VTS backend environment set up. You can :doc:`follow our earlier tutorial <vtsbackend>` to do so.

You will need at least 10GiBs of free disk space.

Some of the steps you will perform are quite CPU intensive. A quad core node / droplet is recommended. A dual core is fine, but get yourself some coffee and biscuits.    

Make sure you use the ``vts`` system user for data manipulation commands in the rest of this tutorial::

    $ sudo -iu vts


As a good practice, create a resource directory and dataset subdirectory to configure and store our Mars-related resources

::

   $ sudo -iu vts
   $ mkdir /etc/vts/mapproxy/mars-case-study.d
   $ mkdir ~/mapproxy/datasets/mars-case-study

and extend your mapproxy resource configuration to include these resources:

::

    [
        { "include": "examples.d/*.json" }
        ,{ "include": "mars-case-study.d/*.json" }
    ]


The Global Mosaic
"""""""""""""""""
For a global model of any celestial body, you need a global mosaic. We choose the 232m/px `Mars Viking MDIM21 Color Mosaic <https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/Viking/MDIM21/Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m>`_ available from USGS Astrogeology Science Center.

The `original file <https://planetarymaps.usgs.gov/mosaic/Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m.tif>`_ is almost 12GiBs and takes quite a while to download. You might prefer to obtain a deflated 5GiB version from our servers::

    $ cd ~/mapproxy/datasets/mars-case-study
    $ wget https://cdn.melown.com/pub/vts-tutorials/mars-peaks-and-valleys/Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m.tif

Alas, there are no overviews in this dataset. For large files, overviews are needed for VTS backend to handle them efficently. Use ``generatevrtwo`` utility to create a tiled virtual dataset with overviews. Depending on your CPU resources, overview generation may take some time::

   $ generatevrtwo --input Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m.tif --output Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m.average --resampling average --wrapx 0 --co PREDICTOR=2 --co ZLEVEL=9 --tileSize 4096x4096

The ``--wrapx`` parameter above indicates that the image is cyclical and that it has no overlapping pixels. It is important to obtain a seamless result in overviews. 

The virtual dataset created is in fact in ``<generatewrtwo-output-dir>/dataset``. Creating a symbolic link to access it is practical::

   $ ln -s Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m.average/dataset mars-viking-mdim21 
 
Take some measurements from the dataset using the ``mapproxy-calipers`` utility::

    $ mapproxy-calipers mars-viking-mdim21 --referenceFrame mars-qsc
    2017-07-13 14:57:43 I3 [17237(main)]: [mapproxy-calipers] Config:
	dataset = "/var/vts/mapproxy/datasets/mars-case-study/mars-viking-mdim21"
	referenceFrame = mars-qsc
    ... some low level errors you may safely ignore ...
    range<qsc-right-dmars2000>: 2,9 9/256,128:383,255
    range<qsc-back-dmars2000>: 2,9 9/384,128:511,255
    range<qsc-left-dmars2000>: 2,9 9/0,128:127,255
    range<qsc-front-dmars2000>: 2,9 9/128,128:255,255
    range<qsc-top-dmars2000>: 2,9 9/128,0:255,127
    range<qsc-bottom-dmars2000>: 2,9 9/128,256:255,383
    range: 2,9 0,0:3,2
    position: obj,0.007055,0.000000,float,0.000000,0.000000,-90.000000,0.000000,6792334.739508,55.000000

The important part of the information above is the tile and lod range, on the second line from bottom. You will use it in the next step. 

And finally, configure the mapproxy resource. Create a resource configuration file at ``/etc/vts/mapproxy/mars-case-study.d/mars-viking-mdim21.json`` with the following contents::

    [{
        "group" : "mars-case-study",
        "id" : "mars-viking-mdim21",
        "comment" : "Mars Viking MDIM21 Mosaic",
        "type" : "tms",
        "driver" : "tms-raster",
        "definition" :  {
            "dataset" : "mars-case-study/mars-viking-mdim21",
            "format" : "jpg",
            "transparent" : false
        },
        "referenceFrames" : {
            "mars-qsc" : {
                "lodRange" : [ 2, 9 ],
                "tileRange" : [
                    [ 0, 0 ],
                    [ 3, 2 ]
                ]
            }
        },
        "registry" : {
            "credits" : {
                "nasa-ames" : {
                    "id" : 201,
                     "notice" : "NASA Ames"
                }
            }
        },
        "credits" : [ "nasa-ames" ]
    }]


This resource configuration file creates a VTS mapproxy tiled map service resource based on the dataset provided. Among other things, it tells VTS mapproxy that the resource shall be known under "mars-case-study-mars-viking-mdim21" group/id combination and it uses the tile hierarchy defined by ``mars-qsc`` reference frame. The ``lodRange`` and ``tileRange`` are merely a transformation of the following line you've seen in the output of mapproxy-calipres above::

  range: 2,9 0,0:3,2

VTS Mapproxy will process this configuration automatically within five minutes. If you do not feel like waiting run

::

    $ sudo echo update-resources | socat -T2 - UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/vts-backend-mapproxy.ctrl

A browsable, multi-resolution tiled color mosaic of Mars should be now available on your system. Point your browser to the following URL to play with it
::

   http://<yourserver>:8070/mapproxy/mars-qsc/tms/mars-case-study/mars-viking-mdim21/ 

You should something like this:

.. image:: mars-peaks-and-valleys-colormosaic.jpg

Indeed, ``mars-qsc`` reference frame represents Mars as a folded-out cube. Zoom and pan to see some of the details of your new VTS resource.

The Terrain
"""""""""""

The 2D map you have just created is fun but you are after something more ambitious: a browsable 3D model of the planet. To achieve this, you need a global DEM. A good choice is 463m/px `Mars MGS MOLA Elevation Model <https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/GlobalSurveyor/MOLA/Mars_MGS_MOLA_DEM_mosaic_global_463m>`_, available again from USGS Astrogeology Science Center. Download it as follows::

    $ cd ~/mapproxy/datasets/mars-case-study
    $ wget http://astropedia.astrogeology.usgs.gov/download/Mars/GlobalSurveyor/MOLA/ancillary/mola128_mola64_merge_90Nto90S_SimpCyl_clon0_LZW.tif    

Like the global mosaic, this dataset needs overviews to be handled efficiently. And unlike the global mosaic, you will need three different types of datasets created with different filters. Here they come::

    $ for resampling in min max cubicspline; do \ 
        generatevrtwo --input mola128_mola64_merge_90Nto90S_SimpCyl_clon0_LZW.tif \
            --output mola128_mola64_merge_90Nto90S_SimpCyl_clon0_LZW.$resampling \
            --resampling $resampling --wrapx 1; done

The ``--wrapx 1`` parameter indicates that the image is cyclical (as most global datasets for celestial bodies are) and defines the number of overlapping pixels on the sides of the mosaic. You may want to use ``gdalinfo`` utility to verify that the first and last columns in this mosaic are indeed identical.    

Now, create a directory to hold symbolic links to these datasets::

    $ mkdir mars-mola-dem && cd mars-mola-dem 
    $ ln -s ../mola128_mola64_merge_90Nto90S_SimpCyl_clon0_LZW.cubicspline/dataset dem
    $ ln -s ../mola128_mola64_merge_90Nto90S_SimpCyl_clon0_LZW.min/dataset dem.min
    $ ln -s ../mola128_mola64_merge_90Nto90S_SimpCyl_clon0_LZW.max/dataset dem.max
    $ cd .. 


Take some measurements of one of the datasets through ``mapproxy-calipers``::

    $ mapproxy-calipers mars-mola-dem/dem --referenceFrame mars-qsc
    ... some errors you may safely ignore ...
    gsd: 460.358
    range<qsc-left-dmars2000>: 2,9 9/0,128:127,255
    range<qsc-front-dmars2000>: 2,9 9/128,128:255,255
    range<qsc-right-dmars2000>: 2,9 9/256,128:383,255
    range<qsc-bottom-dmars2000>: 2,10 10/256,512:511,767
    range<qsc-top-dmars2000>: 2,10 10/256,0:511,255
    range: 2,10 0,0:3,2
    position: obj,0.000000,0.000000,float,0.000000,0.000000,-90.000000,0.000000,8830036.910103,45.000000

The second line from the bottom tells you the level-of-detail range (from 2 to 10) and the tile range at coarsest LoD 2 (column 0 to 3, row 0 to 2). The bottom line gives you as a hint as to what should be used as the initial VTS position for a map based on this resource. We shall make use of this information later.

There is one more step to terrain data preprocessing, resource tiling. VTS mapproxy needs a quick way to determine if a given tile in a multi-resolution hierarchy exists. To create resource tile index, run the ``mapproxy-tiling`` utility::

    $ mapproxy-tiling --input mars-mola-dem --referenceFrame mars-qsc \
        --lodRange 2,10 --tileRange 0,0:3,2

Note that we have made use of the LoD and tile ranges we learned earlier from ``mapproxy-calipers``.

You're almost done now. Create mapproxy resource configuration file at ``/etc/vts/mapproxy/mars-case-study.d/mars-mola-dem.json`` with the following contents::


    [{
        "group" : "mars-case-study",
        "id" : "mars-mola-dem",
        "comment" : "Mars MGS MOLA Elevation Model",
        "type" : "surface",
        "driver" : "surface-dem",
        "definition" : {
            "dataset" : "mars-case-study/mars-mola-dem",
            "introspection": {
                "tms": {
                    "group": "mars-case-study",
                    "id": "mars-viking-mdim21"
                },
                "position": ["obj",0.001328,0,"float",0,0,-90,0,8830036.054687,45.000000]
            }
        },
        "referenceFrames" : {
            "mars-qsc" : {
                "lodRange" : [ 2, 10 ],
                "tileRange" : [
                    [ 0, 0 ],
                    [ 3, 2 ]
                ]
            }
        },
        "registry" : {
            "credits" : {
                "goddard" : {
                    "id" : 202,
                    "notice" : "Goddard Space Flight Center"
                }
            }
        },
        "credits" : [ "goddard" ]
    }]


This resource configuration file creates a VTS mapproxy surface resource based on the DEM dataset provided. Among other things, it tells VTS mapproxy that the resource shall be known under "mars-case-study-mars-mola-dem" group/id combination and it uses the tile hierarchy defined by ``mars-qsc`` reference frame. Once again, we have used the LoD and tile ranges we learned earlier from ``mapproxy-calipers``. 

An interesting part of the above configuration is the *introspection* object. VTS mapproxy provides a powerful introspection interface, which allows you to inspect configured resources with dynamically created map configurations. Through the introspection object you give guidelines as to what this configuration should contain (which is a simple alternative to writing a VTS storage view). In this case, you have told VTS mapproxy that the surface should be draped over with the global mosaic we configured before. You have also defined the initial position for the map, based on the infromation you previously gathered from ``mapproxy-calipers``. 

VTS Mapproxy will process this configuration automatically within five minutes. If you do not feel like waiting run

::

    sudo /etc/init.d/vts-backend-mapproxy force-update 
 
All right now. Point your browser to

::

    http://<your server>:8070/mapproxy/mars-qsc/surface/mars-case-study/mars-mola-dem/?pos=obj,-77.442856,-7.249034,fix,3502.77,-78.57,-30.97,0.00,261871.59,45.00

On the first try rendering of the map will take quite some time, but eventually, this is what you will see:

.. image:: mars-peaks-and-valleys-terrain.jpg

You are looking into the massive equatorial canyons of *Ius Chasma* which form one of the planet's most striking topographical features. Zoom in or out, pan, or rotate your view to look around.

That's it! You are now streaming a browseable, interactive 3D map of Mars from your system. In :doc:`some of our next tutorials <mars-peaks-and-valleys-searchable-nomenclature>`, we're going to take a look at how to complement this map with even more visual detail and compelling features.
