There are two server
applications :ref:`mapproxy` and :ref:`vtsd` and there are more client
applications too, namely the :ref:`vts-browser-js` and :ref:`vts-browser-cpp`
for now, but we do plan to add more in the future.

As already said, there are two server-side applications, :ref:`mapproxy` and
:ref:`vtsd`. The :ref:`mapproxy` is responsible for serving 3D data and bound
layers to client apps, while :ref:`vtsd` is responsible for creating the 3D data
meshes and *glueing* them together on edges.

The javascript-based :ref:`vts-browser-js` client is then consuming data from
Mapproxy and visualizing them using WebGL in the window of web browser. It also
provides API, to help users create their own applications.

The C++ :ref:`vts-browser-cpp` client is working the same way and consumes the
same configuration file. It's rendering 3D scene using OpenGL library. The
:ref:`vts-browser-cpp` is meant as *library*, but there are two sample
applications included ``vts-browser-qt`` and ``vts-browser-glfw``, which are
build by default.

    VTS 3D mapping stack architecture



===========
Basic terms
===========

There are two ways to onlook on Melown VTS: either from the client side
(interpreting existing data), or from the server side (composing or creating
data). We call the first perspective *analysis* and the second perspective
*synthesis*. In this part, we are focusing on *analysis*, since we are will be
describing, how the backe-end part works.

Typical analytical concepts in VTS are that of configuration, surface and
layers.

.. _bound-layer:

Bound layer
-----------
Bound layers are tiled datasets which may complement a :ref:`surface`. The
adjective *bound* (as opposed to :ref:`free-layer`\s) means that for any tile
used from a bound layer, there is the corresponding tile from the active
surface, having the same :ref:`lod`, and indices.  For this reason, bound layers
**do not**, in essence, **require any metatile information**, as they take it
from the active surface. Bound layers are usually used as texture overlays for
surfaces (e.g. aerial photos).

.. _credit:

Credits
-------
Each data source can have credits, or *attributions* defined. See
:ref:`mapproxy-configuration` for more details.

.. _free-layer:

Free layer
----------

Free layers are collections of three dimensional information capable of
independent rendering. There are two facets to this independence: unlike bound
layers, free layers do not require the active surface to determine their
position. And unlike surfaces, they do not exclude other surfaces from
rendering. As many free layers as needed may be rendered at a given position in
the reference frame's node hierarchy.

If a free layer is tiled, or organized in a tile hierarchy, it holds also an
independent hierarchy of metatiles to achieve its independence on the active
surface. In format and semantics, free layer metatiles are precisely identical
to surface metatiles. Their usage in the rendering pipeline is largely identical
as with surfaces. Each free layer, however, forms its own independent,
single-entity rendering stack.

For configuration options, have a look at :ref:`geodata` resources configuration
section.


.. _geogrid:

Geogrid
-------
Usually raster representation of height differences between used ellipsoid and
real Earth surface `Geoid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid>`_ heights.

.. figure:: images/geoid-grid.png

.. _glue:

Glue
----

A glue is synthetised :ref:`tileset` from two or more original tilesets, to minimize
data transfare and rendering time of final representation. Glues are
pre-rendered on the server, so that client does not have to do the work multiple
times.

.. figure:: images/glue1.png
    :scale: 25%

    Green and white tiles are representing *glue* tiles between two tilesets,
    with representing different surfaces. Gray tiles "in the center" and gray
    tiles "on the permiter" are taken from original tilesets during final
    rendering.

.. figure:: images/glue-mesh.png
    :scale: 25%

    Final "glue mesh", used for one :ref:`lod` to represent tiles, which are
    both covered by two tilesets.

.. _lod:

Level of detail (LOD)
---------------------

Level of detail. In traditional GIS this might be similar to zoom scale. It can
be displayed as the "pyramid" in the upper picture.

.. _mask:

Mask
----
Mask is special file, which can be used as standard binary mask, which "masks
out" pixels out of region of interest.

.. _metatile:

Meta tile
---------
Tile, holding *meta informations* needed to construct 3D model from input
:ref:`mesh` and :ref:`texture` tiles.

.. _mesh:

Polygon mesh
------------
`Polygon mesh <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh>`_ is collection of
vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape of a polyhedral object in 3D
computer graphics and solid modeling. The faces usually consist of triangles
(triangle mesh), quadrilaterals, or other simple convex polygons, since this
simplifies rendering, but may also be composed of more general concave polygons,
or polygons with holes.

In VTS, meshes are used to construct final 3D surface, covered with
:ref:`texture`\s.

    Flatshaded mesh, rendered as surface

.. figure:: images/mesh-wireframe.png
    :scale: 50%

    Image mesh filled with :ref:`texture`\s

.. _reference-frame:

Reference Frame
---------------
Although they are closely related, a
reference frame is not the same thing as a :ref:`srs` (SRS) a
*reference frame* defines multiple SRSes, and each of these serves a different
purpose. In the simple example we discussed, some of these systems were
identical, and others hardcoded and thus did not call for an explicit
definition.

The concept of reference frames is of crucial importance in VTS design. In order
to create and use 3D map data, we need answers to questions such as:

Which coordinate system (or more precisely spatial reference) are geometries
within polygonal :ref:`mesh`\s and metatiles? When the user navigates the map,
what is logic of motion? For example, what does pan motion mean, geometricaly?
When we rotate around and object, what is the axis of rotation?  When we report
spatial coordinates to the user, how do they relate to the coordinate system
used for geometries?  There is a tile hierarchy within the map. How is the map
split into tiles? Is there a way to tell the physical extents of a tile with
given indices on a given :ref:`lod`?

We need a more generic way to define a reference frame. Hence a reference frame
consists of:

#. **Physical** spatial reference system, employed by meta node bounding boxes, by
   mesh and free layer geometries
#. **Navigational** spatial reference system, whose XY plane defines tangential
   movement (pan) and objective rotational movement (orbit) as movement along
   the plane and rotation around axis perpendicular to the plane, respectively;
   its Z component is employed by navigation tiles and it is the system used in
   positioning, both to define position and orientation
#. **Public** spatial reference system, which is used when interfacing with the user
   (when informing user of current position in the map or of altitude or when
   handling user input)
#. Spatial division, which defines physical extents of the model and extents of
   every tile on every level-of-detail (LOD), either explicitly (for a specific
   tile) or by setting out a rule by which tiles are split into subtiles.
   Several points should be made here.


.. _texture:

Texture
-------

`Texture map <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping>`_
is a method for defining high frequency detail, surface texture, or color
information on a computer-generated graphic or 3D model. In VTS, each surface
tile contains also reference to metainformation-tile, which further contains
reference to textures applied to the :ref:`mesh`. Textures are stored as simple
JPEG images.

.. figure:: images/internal-texture.jpg
    :scale: 50%

    Image containing mesh textures

.. _tileset:

Tileset
-------
A tiled surface (set of meshes with metadata) meshes are
textured: usually, but not necessarily corresponding to a given reference frame
possibly taking advantage of external texture layers containing :ref:`credit`\s
(copyrights, attributions)

.. _resource:

Resource
--------

Data sources defined in ``JSON`` encoded file, used in :ref:`mapproxy`. The data
sources can be DEMs or :ref:`bound-layer`\s with map.

.. _srs:

Spatial reference system
------------------------
`Spatial reference system
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system>`_ (SRS) is a
coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical
entities. A spatial reference system defines a specific map projection, as well
as transformations between different spatial reference systems. In GIS, usually
use `EPSG <https://www.epsg-registry.org/>`_ datase, however, EPSG codes are
not used in VTS* tools. SRS is stored in internal :ref:`registry` database.

.. _storage:

Storage
-------
Storage is a stack of :ref:`tileset` sharing the same :ref:`reference-frame`.
Surface display priority is defined by tileset stacking order (first in, last
out). It also contains :ref:`glue`\ s between it's constituent tilesets.
contains :ref:`glue`\ s. It's basicaly a database of all your tilesets.

.. _storage-view:

Storage view
-------------
Storage view is subset of :ref:`storage`, with selected :ref:`tileset`\ s, so
that you are not going to render all your data in final application.

.. _surface:

Surface
-------

Surfaces are a client side notion of tilesets. More precisely, they are

* a geometrical definition of the modeled object's surface,
* with optional textures and/or information on how to map external textures to object's surface
* with information on terrain, allowing to map map XY navigation SRS coordinates to their Z compoment.

Our current webexport format is, under our new terminology, a representation of
a single surface. It is a surface which is tiled (organized in a tile hierarchy)
and sampled (described as a set of polygonal meshes, as opposed to using
analytical and implicit functions). We shall preserve this properties in the new
surface format.
