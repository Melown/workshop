.. _resources:

===================
Resources reference
===================

In the section :ref:`mapproxy-configuration`, we provided VTS-Mapproxy with link
to resource configuration file in the ``[resource-backend]`` section. 
There are two possible ways, how to define resources - using configuration file
or using :ref:`resources-python`.

The sample configuration can be seen in :download:`../examples/resources.json` file
example. Generic JSON file structure looks following::

    [{
        ...
        resource1 definition
        ...
    },
    {
        ...
        resource2 definition
        ...
    },
    ...
    ]

----------

Tiled map service driver definition

One of
^^^^^^

+ :ref:`tms-raster`
+ :ref:`tms-raster-remote`
+ :ref:`tms-patchwork`
+ :ref:`tms-bing`

.. _tms-raster:

tms-raster
----------

Raster-based bound layer generator. Uses any raster GDAL dataset as its data
source. Supports optional data masking.

+ ``dataset`` (string) - path to GDAL dataset
+ ``mask`` (string, optional) - path to RF mask or masking GDAL dataset
+ ``format`` (string, optional) - output image format, "jpg" or "png" (defaults to "jpg")
+ ``transparent`` (boolean, optional) - Boundlayer is transparent, forces format to "png"

.. _tms-raster-remote:

``remoteUrl`` (a URL template). Supports optional data masking.

+ ``remoteUrl`` (:ref:`url`) - Imagery URL template.
+ ``mask`` (string) - path to RF mask or masking GDAL dataset

.. _tms-patchwork:

Simple raster bound layer generator. Generates color checkered tiles. Supports optional data masking.

* ``mask`` (string, optional) - path to RF mask or masking GDAL dataset
* ``format`` (string, optional) - output image format, "jpg" or "png" (defaults to "jpg")

.. _tms-bing:

tms-bing
--------

Bound layer generator for remote Bing data. Valid session is generated via metatada URL.

* ``metadataUrl`` (string) - Bing API metadata URL. See Bing API documentation for more info.

.. _surface-driver:

Surface driver
--------------

Surface drivers generate a meshed surface that can be used directly as a single
surface or merged into VTS storage as a remote tileset. In addition, a
:file:`freelayer.json` file is provided allowing generated surface to act as a
mesh-tiles free layer.

Common surdace driver configuration options

+ ``geoidGrid`` (string) - name of Proj.4's geoid grid file (e.g. `egm96_15.gtx`).
+ ``nominalTexelSize`` (number) - nominal resolution (meter/pixel); reported by :ref:`mapproxy-calipers`
+ ``mergeBottomLod`` (number) - Reported in generated :file:`tileset.conf`, speeds up merge with other surfaces
+ ``introspection`` (array[:ref:`introspection`] | Object[:ref:`introspection`]) - Introspection info used when using :file:`mapConfig.json` served by :ref:`mapproxy`

If there is just one TMS resource used in the introspection then the enclosing array is optional.

One of
^^^^^^

+ :ref:`surface-spheroid`
+ :ref:`surface-dem`

.. _surface-spheroid:

surface-spheroid
----------------

This driver generates meshed surface for reference frame's spheroid. If geoid
grid is provided the resulting body is in fact a geoid.

If a ``textureLayerId`` entry is present this ID is written into generated meshes as
a default bound layer to use if nothing else is mapped on the surface. Otherwise
surface is completely texture less.

+ `textureLayerId` (number, optional) - numeric bound layer ID

.. _surface-dem:

surface-dem
-----------

This driver generates a meshed surface from the supplied GDAL raster DEM/DSM/DTM
dataset.

Since GDAL raster formats are unable to safely store vertical SRS component it
cannot tell whether data are in ellipsoidal or orthometric verical datum.
Therefore by default the heights are treated as if they are above the ellipsoid
(i.e. ellipsoidal vertical datum). By providing a geoidGrid configuration option
we can specify geoid grid for the orthormetric vertical datum, i.e. to tell that
the heights store in the GDAL dataset are relative to given geoid.

Please be aware that due to such limitations the GDAL dataset's vertical system
must be compatible with reference frame's vertical system to use geoid support.
I.e. either they share the same ellipsoid or the input data are in some local
system that approximates the geoid at given place. One working example is data
in Krovak's projection that can be reinterpreted as heights above WGS84+EGM96
without any significant error.

If a ``textureLayerId`` entry is present this ID is written into generated meshes as
a default bound layer to use if nothing else is mapped on the surface. Otherwise
surface is completely texture less.

All :ref:`surface-dem` input datasets are registered in internal map lod available DEM's
under its group-id identifier and can be referenced from various
geodataresources for 2D features height config. Optionially, input dataset can be
registered in this map under an alias. See more in the geodata resources
documentation.

+ ``dataset`` (string) - path to complex dataset
+ ``mask`` (string, optional) - optional mask, generated by :ref:`mapproxy-rf-mask` tool
+ ``textureLayerId`` (number, optional) - numeric bound layer ID
+ ``heightcodingAlias`` (string, optional) - dataset is registered under given alias

.. _geodata:

Geodata
-------

Geodata drivers generate vector geographic data in the form of :ref:`free-layer`.

One of
^^^^^^

+ :ref:`geodata-vector`
+ :ref:`geodata-vector-tiled`

.. _geodata-vector:

geodata-vector
--------------

Generates monolithic free layer (geodata type) from an OGR-supported dataset
(GeoJSON, shapefile, ...). Purely 2D data are converted to full 3D data using
process called heigth coding: each 2D coordinate is extended by height read from
the accompanying DEM/DTM/DSM GDAL dataset.

Height coding DEM is in the same format a the dataset expected by :ref:`surface-dem`
driver although only its ``/dem`` part is used. This DEM can be accompanied with its
geoid grid in the same way as :ref:`surface-dem` is.

By default all layers from the source dataset are served. Optionally, layer
subset can be configured by providing list of layer names.

+ ``dataset`` (string) - path to OGR dataset
+ ``demDataset`` (string) - path to complex dem dataset
+ ``geoidGrid`` (string, optional) - name of Proj.4's geoid grid file (e.g. `egm96_15.gtx`)
+ ``layers`` (array[string], optional) - list of layers names
+ ``format`` (string, optional) - output file format, so far only "geodataJson" is supported (default)
+ ``styleUrl`` (string, optional) - URL to default geodata style
+ ``displaySize`` (string, optional) - Nominal size of tile in pixels.
+ ``introspection`` (:ref:`introspection`, optional) - Extended configuration for mapConfig.json served by mapproxy

Introspection can be used to serve ``mapConfig`` where geodata are show with some surface which in turn can have its own introspection configuration.

.. _geodata-vector-tiled:

geodata-vector-tiled
--------------------

Generates tiled geodata (geodata-tiles type) from pre-tiled data. Input tiling
must match reference frame's space division, at least in one of its nodes. For
example, OSM tiles in pseudomerc projection can be used in ``webmerc-projected`` and
``webmerc-unprojected`` :ref:`reference-frame`\s and in the ``pseudomerc`` subtree in in
``melown2015`` reference frame.

Configuration is the same as for :ref:`geodata-vector` driver but input interpretation
is different and served data are different.

Geodata's metatiles are generated purely from heightcoding GDAL dataset.


+ ``dataset`` (:ref:`url`) - Option definition.dataset is a OGR dataset path/URL template that is expanded for each requested tile before opening and processing.


.. _introspection:

Introspection
-------------

Introspection is extending configuration for :ref:`mapproxy` served :file:`mapConfig.json`
(only when browsing is enabled).

+ ``position`` (array[number]) - VTS position in JSON/python format
+ ``tms`` (object) - bound layer(s) mapped on the surface, see below 
    + ``group`` (string) - group part of TMS resource identifier
    + ``id`` (string) - ID part of TMS resource identifier


.. _url:

URL template
------------
This is documented elsewhere but as a convenience we provide URL template
expansion documentation here.

Each tile has its global and local ``tileId``. For simple reference frames (like
``webmerc-projected``) global and local identifers are the same.

For complex reference frames (``melown2015``, ``earth-qsc``) global identifier
is from tile tree root, i.e. from 0-0-0. Local identifier is tile identifier
relative to its reference frame subtree.

For example (in ``melown2015``):
    + tile with global ID 10-256-256 is in the pseudomerc subtree with root at
      1-0-0 and its local ID is 9-256-256
    + tile with global ID 10-768-512 is in the steres-wgs84 subtree with root at
      1-1-0 and its local ID is also 9-256-256

Available expansion strings. Only some make sense for templates used in
:ref:`mapproxy`.

+ ``{lod}`` - global tile LOD
+ ``{x}`` - global tile X index
+ ``{y}`` - global tile Y index
+ ``{loclod}`` - local tile LOD
+ ``{locx}`` - local tile X index
+ ``{locy}`` - local tile Y index
+ ``{sub}`` - sub-tile identifier (e.g. submesh index in atlas image)'
+ ``{alt(1,2,3,4)}`` - exands to one of given strings
+ ``{ppx}`` - tile's old PP space X index (makes sense only in ppspace)
+ ``{ppy}`` - tile's old PP space Y index (makes sense only in ppspace)
