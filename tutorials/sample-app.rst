Writing a Simple VTS-Browser-JS application
-------------------------------------------

In this tutorial we set up a basic JavaScript web application using the latest `VTS Browser JS <https://github.com/Melown/vts-browser-js>`__ hosted at `Melown Tech's <https://www.melown.com>`__ CDN. The app will allow you to browse any map for which you have the :ref:`map configuration <map-configuration>`.

HTML Page
^^^^^^^^^

You have to add 2 files to your web page, the CSS file and the
:ref:`vts-browser-js` library (minified version):

.. literalinclude:: srcs/sample-app.html
   :lines: 7-9
   :language: html
   :linenos:

Then, target ``<div />`` element has to be set:

.. literalinclude:: srcs/sample-app.html
   :lines: 13-14
   :language: html
   :linenos:

And finally, the final JavaScript Application will be add to in separated file:

.. literalinclude:: srcs/sample-app.html
   :lines: 15
   :language: html
   :linenos:

You can download :download:`srcs/sample-app.html` and test the file at your
server.

JavaScript Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code is straigt forward, you have to initialize the browser with two
parameters: 

#. Target ``<div />`` element ID
#. Map configuration JSON file

.. literalinclude:: srcs/sample-app.js
    :lines: 9-11

You can download :download:`srcs/sample-app.js` the javascript code too.
