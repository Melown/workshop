Publishing tiled vector data
----------------------------

Vector data as we know them in GIS, are called :ref:`free-layer` in terms of
VTS ecosystem. For displaying large vector data sets in map viewers, the data
need usually to be tiled using some predefied tiling schema.

The vector data have their own coordinate reference system definition,
and the tiling is tided to specific tiling schema - not necessary related to
used reference frame. For configuration details, have a look at
:ref:`geodata-vector-tiled` configuration.

The main difference between vector data source (:ref:`free-layer`) and tiled
vector data is, that it allows us to display much larger datasets, adjusted to
specific :ref:`lod` (or zoom scale). 

.. note:: Mapproxy currently supports just lines and points. Polygons are not
    yet available for rendering.

In our example, we will continue with the :ref:`srtm-example` project (you can
also take what you have in the :ref:`freelayer-example` project), where we
have `SRTM <https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/>`_ elevation data along with Czech
and Austrian WMTS aerial image layers.

.. note:: If you do not have ``resources.json`` and ``mapproxy.conf`` files yet,
    go to the :ref:`srtm-example` project and come back, after you have working
    project.

We may now add new resource of type :ref:`geodata-vector-tiled`.

Download the data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
VTS supports tiled vectors stored in the
`MapBox vector tiles format`_ . One of
possible sources can be https://openmaptiles.org/, provided by `Klokan
Technologies <https://www.klokantech.com/>`_. We are going to download Austria
free tiles from https://openmaptiles.org/downloads/#country

Once you agree to the license, you can download the file
:file:`austria.mbtiles`.

Configure ``resources.json``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now have our input data and can add new resource to
:download:`projects/freelayer-tiled/mapproxy-wmts-vector-tiled.json`

.. literalinclude:: projects/freelayer-tiled/mapproxy-wmts-vector-tiled.json
    :linenos:
    :lines: 2-36

The first part should be clear already, with exception for reference frame
definition. Vector dataset is tiled and we can find out it's optimal tile range
and :ref:`lod` range using :ref:`mapproxy-calipers`::

    $ mapproxy-calipers mapproxy-wmts/datasets/austria.mbtiles  --referenceFrame melown2015

    gsd: 6.43044
    range<pseudomerc>: 6,15 15/8621,5618:8977,5810
    range: 6,15 16,10:17,11
    position: obj,13.345765,47.696427,float,0.000000,0.000000,-90.000000,0.000000,603088.436364,55.000000

The ``range`` line is used for the ``referenceFrames`` attribute in layer
configuration.

Since we need to display copyright informations for `OpenStreetMap
<http://openstreetmap.org>`_ and `OpenMapTiles`_, we
need to extend :ref:`registry` database with this informations (see
``registry``).

Last part, the source ``definition`` is similar to :ref:`freelayer-example`.
You should be familiar with most
of the values, for reference have a look to :ref:`geodata-vector-tiled` documentation.
There is one important parameter ``dataset``, which is the reference the our
downloaded ``mbtiles`` file - you need to specify it's `x`, `y` and `lod`
parameters like it would be used in the URL, therefore we use::

    ...
    "dataset": "austria.mbtiles/{loclod}-{locx}-{locy}",
    ...
    

Vector data styling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. note:: Detailed reference for styling is behind scope of this example, please
    check `official styling documentation
    <https://github.com/Melown/vts-browser-js/wiki/VTS-Geodata-Format#geo-layer-styles-structure>`_.

Vector data styles are stored in JSON format. We shall discuss this in separate
example. In our case, we just use simple style file.

.. literalinclude:: projects/freelayer/style.json

.. note:: styleUrl is not mandatory parameter - the vector data are going to be
    displayed anyhow.

Running
^^^^^^^
Once set, you can re-run ``mapproxy`` and see your vector map::

    $ mapproxy --config mapproxy.conf

.. figure:: images/austria-mbtiles.jpg
